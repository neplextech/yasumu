# Workspaces

A **workspace** in Yasumu is the core organizational unit for your API
development workflow. It's a directory-based structure that lives
alongside your source code, designed for collaboration and version
control.

## How Workspaces Work

When you open Yasumu on a project directory, it creates a `yasumu`
folder containing all your API definitions. This folder stores
everything in human-readable `.ysl` files that can be committed to
version control.

```
my-project/
├── src/
├── package.json
└── yasumu/
    ├── workspace.ysl
    ├── environment/
    │   ├── h49ehcz1o96rglpym0qjqr3a.ysl
    │   └── z85bde4ytdta7d1u0ndjfoh6.ysl
    ├── rest/
    │   ├── wmz1pu98ovohr1k44dbldpjt.ysl
    │   └── uaro9t8o2j31rufvghiyn4yr.ysl
    ├── smtp.ysl
    └── yasumu-lock.json
```

## File Naming Convention

Yasumu uses unique IDs for file names (e.g.,
`wmz1pu98ovohr1k44dbldpjt.ysl`). The human-readable names are stored
inside the files in the `metadata` block. This approach:

- Avoids file name conflicts
- Prevents issues with special characters
- Makes renaming entities simple (only file contents change)

## Workspace Configuration

The `workspace.ysl` file contains the core workspace configuration:

```
@workspace

metadata {
  id: "9qh64om0zya1lp9ejcgrh3rq"
  name: "my-project"
  version: 0
}

snapshot 1766908485545

groups {}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field      | Description                         |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Unique identifier for the workspace |
| `name`     | Display name for the workspace      |
| `version`  | Workspace schema version            |
| `snapshot` | Timestamp of last modification      |
| `groups`   | Request grouping configuration      |

## Lock File

The `yasumu-lock.json` file tracks all entities in the workspace:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "entities": {
    "workspace": { ... },
    "rest": { ... },
    "environment": { ... },
    "smtp": { ... },
    "group": {}
  }
}
```

Each entity entry contains:

- `hash` — Content hash for change detection
- `lastSyncedAt` — Timestamp of last synchronization

## Git Integration

Workspaces are designed to be committed alongside your source code:

### Benefits of Version Control

- **Collaboration** — Team members can pull and see updated API
  definitions immediately
- **History** — Track changes to API configurations over time
- **Code Review** — Diff-friendly text files make reviewing changes
  straightforward
- **Branching** — Test different API configurations on feature
  branches

<Callout type="info" title="Commit Everything">
  Commit the entire `yasumu` folder to version control. The `.ysl`
  format is designed to be human-readable and produce clean diffs.

## Default Workspace

Yasumu includes a built-in **Default Workspace** that serves as a
scratchpad for quick experiments and testing. This workspace:

- **Cannot be removed** — It's always available as a fallback
  workspace
- **Cannot be synchronized** — Unlike regular workspaces, it's not
  backed by the file system
- **Ideal for quick tests** — Use it when you don't need persistence
  or version control

The Default Workspace is perfect for one-off API calls or
experimenting before committing to a project-specific workspace.

## Multiple Workspaces

You can have multiple Yasumu workspaces:

- **Per-project workspaces** — Each project has its own `yasumu`
  folder
- **Shared workspaces** — A central workspace for cross-project APIs
- **Team workspaces** — Shared via Git for team collaboration

Switch between workspaces using the workspace menu in the sidebar:

## Importing & Exporting

Yasumu **_currently does not support_** importing from other API
clients, but we plan to add support for the following formats in the
future:

- **Postman Collections**
- **Insomnia Exports**
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**

## Best Practices

1. **Commit your workspace** — Include the entire `yasumu` folder in
   version control
2. **Use environments** — Separate configurations for dev, staging,
   and production
3. **Use variables** — Avoid hardcoding URLs and credentials
4. **Keep secrets secure** — Secret values are stored empty in `.ysl`
   files, actual values are kept locally
