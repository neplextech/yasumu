## Creating Your First Workspace

A workspace in Yasumu is a project folder that contains all your API definitions, environments, and configurations.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open or Create a Workspace

When you launch Yasumu, you can either:
- **Open an existing folder** containing a Yasumu workspace
- **Create a new workspace** in any directory

</Step>
<Step>

### Workspace Initialization

When you open a folder, Yasumu creates a `yasumu` directory containing:

```
your-project/
└── yasumu/
    ├── workspace.ysl
    ├── environment/
    ├── rest/
    ├── smtp.ysl
    └── yasumu-lock.json
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Your First Request

1. Navigate to the **REST** section in the sidebar
2. Click the **+** button to create a new request
3. Enter a URL (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`)
4. Click **Send** to execute the request

You'll see the response displayed in the response panel, including headers, body, and timing information.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Structure

Yasumu uses a file-based structure that integrates naturally with version control:

```
yasumu/
├── workspace.ysl           # Main workspace configuration
├── environment/
│   ├── <id>.ysl           # Environment definitions
│   └── <id>.ysl
├── rest/
│   ├── <id>.ysl           # REST API requests
│   └── <id>.ysl
├── smtp.ysl               # SMTP configuration
└── yasumu-lock.json       # Lock file for sync
```

### The `.ysl` Format

Yasumu uses **Yasumu Schema Language** (`.ysl`) — a human-readable format designed for:
- **Version control** — Easy to diff and merge
- **Readability** — Understand request configurations at a glance
- **Stability** — Consistent structure across versions

Files are named with unique IDs, while human-readable names are stored inside each file.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Yasumu installed, explore:

- [Workspaces](/docs/workspaces) — Learn about workspace organization
- [Requests](/docs/requests) — Master HTTP request configuration
- [Environments](/docs/environments) — Manage variables across environments
- [Echo Server](/docs/echo-server) — Test requests with the built-in echo server
