# Welcome to Yasumu

**Yasumu** is a modern, free, and open-source API laboratory for
designing, testing, and debugging API workflows. Built for developer
productivity, speed, and freedom — without vendor lock-in.

<Callout type="info" title="Beta Software">
  Yasumu is actively under development. You may encounter unfinished
  features, bugs, or inconsistent behavior as we rapidly prototype and
  iterate. We welcome your feedback and contributions!
</Callout>

## Why Yasumu?

Unlike traditional API clients that store data in hidden databases or
require cloud accounts, Yasumu operates like an **IDE for your APIs**.
Your configurations live directly in your project folder, making
collaboration and version control seamless.

It feels like the tools you already know, but with the flexibility to
handle complex, experimental workflows directly in your file system.

### What Makes It Different

Everything lives in your project folder as plain `.ysl` files. Commit
them, diff them, review them in PRs—your API collections are just
another part of your codebase.

The app runs on Tauri with an embedded custom JavaScript runtime
powered by Deno. This handles everything from request execution to
scripting—write your pre-request logic in TypeScript without
external tooling. You can also run `.ysl` files directly from the terminal
for CI/CD integration.

No account required. No cloud sync. No paid tiers.

## Protocol Support

Yasumu is evolving to become a protocol-agnostic powerhouse.

| Protocol               | Status | Notes                                     |
| :--------------------- | :----: | :---------------------------------------- |
| **REST API**           |   ✓    | Full HTTP/HTTPS request support           |
| **Catch-all SMTP**     |   ✓    | Integrated local email server for testing |
| **GraphQL**            |   —    | In development                            |
| **WebSocket**          |   —    | In development                            |
| **Server-Sent Events** |   —    | In development                            |
| **Socket.IO**          |   —    | In development                            |
| **Plugins API**        |   —    | In development                            |

## Concepts & Workflow

Yasumu acts as an **IDE for your API interactions**. Unlike tools that
hide data in proprietary databases or cloud silos, Yasumu lives in
your repo.

### Project-Based Workspaces

When you initialize Yasumu in a project, it creates a `yasumu`
directory. Your definitions, tests, and workflows are stored here
using the **Yasumu Schema Language (.ysl)** — a custom format designed
for readability and clean git diffs.

### Collaboration via Git

- **Commit & Push:** Treat your API collections as code.
- **Review:** `.ysl` files are text-based, making Pull Request reviews
  easy.
- **Sync:** Teammates simply pull the branch to get the latest API
  workflows.
- **Secure:** Sensitive secrets are managed via local environment
  variables, never committed to version control.

### Runtime Architecture

Tauri provides the desktop shell and OS-level operations. The
backend—request execution, scripting, and core logic—runs on an
embedded custom JavaScript runtime built on `deno_runtime`.
