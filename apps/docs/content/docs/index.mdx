# Welcome to Yasumu

**Yasumu** is a modern, free, and open-source API laboratory for designing, testing, and debugging API workflows. Built with performance, developer productivity, and long-term extensibility in mind — without vendor lock-in.

<Callout type="warn" title="Beta Software">
  Yasumu is actively under development. You may encounter unfinished features, bugs, or inconsistent behavior as we rapidly prototype and iterate. We welcome your feedback and contributions!
</Callout>

## Why Yasumu?

Unlike traditional API clients that store data in hidden databases or require cloud accounts, Yasumu operates like an **IDE for your APIs**. Your configurations live directly in your project folder, making collaboration and version control seamless.

### Key Features

- **🌐 Multi-Protocol Testing** — Unified interface for REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, and more.
- **💾 Git-Friendly Storage** — Configurations stored as `.ysl` files for seamless version control.
- **⚡ Native Performance** — Powered by Rust (Tauri) and a custom JavaScript runtime.
- **📜 Pre/Post Scripting** — Modify requests and process responses with JavaScript.
- **🎨 Modern UI** — Built with Next.js for a responsive developer experience.
- **🔓 Open Source** — No artificial feature limitations or mandatory cloud dependencies.

## Protocol Support

| Protocol | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **REST API** | ✅ Ready | Full support for HTTP/HTTPS requests |
| **Catch-all SMTP** | ✅ Ready | Local email server for testing |
