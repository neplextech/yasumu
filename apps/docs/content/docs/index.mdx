# Welcome to Yasumu

**Yasumu** is a modern, free, and open-source API laboratory for designing, testing, and debugging API workflows. Built for developer productivity, speed, and freedom — without vendor lock-in.

<Callout type="warn" title="Beta Software">
  Yasumu is actively under development. You may encounter unfinished features, bugs, or inconsistent behavior as we rapidly prototype and iterate. We welcome your feedback and contributions!
</Callout>

## Why Yasumu?

Unlike traditional API clients that store data in hidden databases or require cloud accounts, Yasumu operates like an **IDE for your APIs**. Your configurations live directly in your project folder, making collaboration and version control seamless.

It feels like the tools you already know, but with the flexibility to handle complex, experimental workflows directly in your file system.

### Key Features

- **💾 Git-Native Workflows** — Save collections as human-readable `.ysl` files. Version control your API tests alongside your code — no more syncing conflicts.
- **⚡ Native Performance** — Engineered with Rust and Tauri for a lightweight footprint and instant startup times.
- **🤖 Deno-Powered Scripting** — Write pre-request and automation scripts using a built-in, secure TypeScript/JavaScript runtime.
- **🌐 Universal Protocol Support** — A unified interface for REST, SMTP, and (soon) WebSockets and GraphQL.
- **🎨 Customizable Themes** — Choose from a variety of built-in color themes to personalize your workspace.
- **🔓 Truly Open Source** — No paywalls, no "pro" features hidden behind cloud subscriptions, and no mandatory login.

## Protocol Support

Yasumu is evolving to become a protocol-agnostic powerhouse.

| Protocol | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **REST API** | ✅ Ready | Full HTTP/HTTPS request support |
| **Catch-all SMTP** | ✅ Ready | Integrated local email server for testing |
| **GraphQL** | 🚧 Soon | In development |
| **WebSocket** | 🚧 Soon | In development |
| **Server-Sent Events** | 🚧 Soon | In development |
| **Socket.IO** | 🚧 Soon | In development |
| **Plugins API** | 🚧 Soon | In development |

## Concepts & Workflow

Yasumu acts as an **IDE for your API interactions**. Unlike tools that hide data in proprietary databases or cloud silos, Yasumu lives in your repo.

### Project-Based Workspaces

When you initialize Yasumu in a project, it creates a `yasumu` directory. Your definitions, tests, and workflows are stored here using the **Yasumu Schema Language (.ysl)** — a custom format designed for readability and clean git diffs.

### Collaboration via Git

- **Commit & Push:** Treat your API collections as code.
- **Review:** `.ysl` files are text-based, making Pull Request reviews easy.
- **Sync:** Teammates simply pull the branch to get the latest API workflows.
- **Secure:** Sensitive secrets are managed via local environment variables, never committed to version control.

### Hybrid Runtime

The core system runs on **Tauri (Rust)** for OS-level operations, while logic and scripting utilize a custom embedded `deno_runtime`, giving you a modern TypeScript environment for automation.
