# Analytics & Privacy

Yasumu collects anonymous usage analytics to help improve the
application. This page explains what data is collected, how it's used,
and how you can opt out.

## Why We Collect Analytics

Analytics help the Yasumu team:

- **Identify issues** — Understand which features are causing problems
  or confusion
- **Prioritize development** — Focus on features that users actually
  use
- **Improve user experience** — Make data-driven decisions about UI/UX
  improvements
- **Track stability** — Monitor crash rates and performance across
  different platforms

## What We Collect

Yasumu uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for analytics. The data
collected is **anonymous** and includes:

- **Feature usage** — Which features are used and how often
- **Navigation patterns** — How users move through the application
- **Performance metrics** — Load times and responsiveness
- **Error events** — When something goes wrong (without personal
  details)
- **Platform information** — Operating system and app version

### What We Don't Collect

Yasumu **never** collects:

- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- Request or response contents
- API keys, tokens, or credentials
- File contents from your workspace
- Environment variable values
- Any data that could identify you or your projects

## Opting Out

Analytics are enabled by default, but you can easily opt out:

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Find the **Privacy** section
3. Toggle off **Usage Analytics**
4. Restart Yasumu for changes to take effect

Once disabled, no analytics data will be collected or sent.

## Data Handling

- Analytics data is processed by PostHog's infrastructure
- Data is retained according to PostHog's data retention policies
- No data is sold to third parties
- Yasumu is open source — you can verify exactly what data is
  collected by reviewing the source code

## Open Source Transparency

Yasumu is fully open source. You can review the analytics
implementation yourself:

  exactly how PostHog is initialized
- [Analytics flag](https://github.com/neplextech/yasumu) — See how the
  opt-out preference is stored and checked
